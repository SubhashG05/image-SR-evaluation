# Image Super-Resolution (SR) Model Evaluation

## Problem Statement

Image Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical image processing technique aimed at improving the resolution of low-resolution images to generate high-resolution images. This technique is essential in various applications, including medical imaging, forensic analysis, satellite imagery, and more. Despite the importance of SR, existing techniques still face several limitations:

1. **Handling Unknown Degradation:** Many SR techniques struggle to effectively manage unknown degradation present in real-world low-resolution images.
2. **Generalization Across Domains:** Existing methods often fail to generalize well across different image domains, leading to inconsistent performance.
3. **Recovering Fine Details:** Current approaches are particularly challenged in recovering fine details, especially at high scaling factors.

Traditional approaches like interpolation and reconstruction-based methods often produce subpar results, prompting the use of deep learning models for SR. However, deep learning models come with their own set of issues, such as:

- **Computational Complexity:** High computational requirements can make deployment challenging in real-world applications.
- **Performance Drop on Real-World Data:** Models trained on synthetic datasets often underperform when applied to real-world images.
- **Dependency on Fixed Scaling Factors:** Most models are trained to work with specific scaling factors, limiting their flexibility.

## Research Objective

This research aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of three popular deep learning-based Super-Resolution models:

1. **Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN)**
2. **SwinIR**
3. **Real-ESRGAN**

The models are evaluated across multiple image domains, including Animals, Cars, Faces, Humans, Landscapes, and Ships, using different scaling factors (x2, x3, x4). 

## Evaluation Metrics

To provide a thorough evaluation, we employ various metrics, including:

- **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**
- **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**
- **Feature Similarity Index (FSIM)**
- **Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)**
- **Objective Difference Image (ODI) Score**
- **Tenengrad Sharpness**
- **Laplacian Variance**

## Proposed Approach

Our approach focuses on evaluating the performance of deep-learning SR models across different domains and scales to understand their strengths and limitations better. This comparative analysis will help identify which models are more efficient, robust, and suitable for real-world scenarios.

By analyzing the results, we aim to:

- Determine the most effective SR model for different image domains.
- Highlight the challenges faced by each model, especially concerning unknown degradations and varying scaling factors.
- Provide insights for future improvements in SR techniques, ensuring they are more adaptable and applicable to real-world applications.
